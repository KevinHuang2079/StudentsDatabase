Student Database Management Program
This is a Python program for managing a student database using SQLite. It provides a user-friendly menu-driven interface to perform various operations such as importing data from a CSV file, printing student records, updating student information, soft-deleting students, and searching for students by different criteria.

The program will display a menu with the following options:

1: Import Data - To import student data from a CSV file.
2: Print Data - Print all non-deleted students.
3: Update Student - To update the field of a specific student, given id.
4: Soft Delete Student - Change the isDeleted field to 1.
5: Search Students - Search for students by major, GPA, city, state, or advisor.
6: Quit - EXIT.

Program Structure
The program is organized into a class-based structure for better modularity and maintainability. The StudentDatabase class represents the database and encapsulates methods for data operations. You can find the database connection setup, data manipulation methods, and the main menu within the class.
